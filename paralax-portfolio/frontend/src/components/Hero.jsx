            I&apos;m Linh, Free-time Software Developer and professional Project
            Powerhouse. Love swimming in the ocean, vietnamese street food,
            cats, curious about the universe, cloud computing, all things art, and all things
            coding.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Currently, I work on projects using the MERN stack because it
            provides a seamless JavaScript-based framework for developing
            full-stack, scalable, and high-performance web applications.

            MongoDB, a NoSQL database, stores data in a flexible, JSON-like
            format, perfect for handling dynamic, unstructured data and
            experimentation. With React, I create interactive and responsive
            user interfaces through reusable components, making the frontend
            highly efficient.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            All that aside, I enjoy the process of solving problems, exploring
            the cloud, and leveraging these technologies to create impactful
            solutions. Please feel free to reach out if you&apos;d like to build
            beautiful, professional websites. I look forward to discuss your
            next project.âœ…
